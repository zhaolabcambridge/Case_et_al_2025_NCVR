## Abstract:
Targeting inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains a major unmet need. Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2<sub>LD</sub>) selectively increases regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers in patients with coronary artery disease. Here, we combine single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor (TCR) analyses and show that IL-2<sub>LD</sub> clonally expands effector Tregs in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The clonally expanded Tregs upregulate key immunosuppressive and metabolic pathways and display an increased number of predicted ligand-receptor interactions. These Tregs also display similar predicted antigen specificities, which cluster with published sequences specific to ASCVD. By tracking the TCRs of single cells over time, we identify an inflammatory polarization of the T cell compartment after myocardial infarction which is restrained by IL-2<sub>LD</sub>. We identify BACH2 as a repressor of the Treg effector program. However, BACH2-mediated regulation is bypassed with IL-2<sub>LD</sub>. Overall, these results lend insight into the IL-2-driven clonal expansion program in human Tregs, with important therapeutic implications for patients with cardiovascular and other immune-mediated diseases.
